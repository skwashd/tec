Technocrat Entity Controller for Drupal 7

This is an API module which provides revision support to Drupal entities. This
code is used internally by Technocrat and may be useful for others.  This is
a slightly hacked version of the Commerce Entity Controller.

We don't feel that this code is d.o worthy and so it will live on github.
